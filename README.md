The project implements the Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) algorithms on the Elliptic Data Set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set).
Further, it corrects the GAT result using the voting method. 

The project is a final result of a course "Graph Algorithms in Machine Learning", conducted at the University of Vienna.
